# Cleaning and Exploring UN Migrant Stock Data
As part of my Programming for Data Science graduate course at UofT, I cleaned this dataset from being human-readible to machine-readible using Tidy data principles outlined by Hadley Wickham in his publication titled "Tidy Data." After cleaning the data using Pandas, I used Matplotlib to visualize the data creating a variety graphs. During my exploratory data analysis, I found a pattern on migratory movements around 2010 in the Middle East. It was being caused by the Syrian Civil War. I used the data and graphs to tell a story about when and where the refugees moved backed with a review of literature online.
